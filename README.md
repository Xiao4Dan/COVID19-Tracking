# About the Project

This project is a COVID-19 Tracking App which I built in order to track the spread of covid-19 by country using an open [API](https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/covid-19/#featured-collections). The webpage is designed to be ```Minimalistic``` and ```responsive``` by screen width.

This project is hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) at [m0vrec](https://m0vrec.web.app/)

## Built with

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

# Conclusion

Features can be added by establishing database so that users can login and add friends.
Then when they are out of ideas what to watch, simply browse unwatched recommendations from friends with similar interest, or invite friends to watch together.
